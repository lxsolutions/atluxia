# Unified WebApp Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a unified web application that combines all Atluxia modules (Nomad Life, Polyverse, Everpath, Curio Critters) into a single cohesive platform with shared navigation and authentication.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Unified Application Architecture

- **Port**: Runs on port 3000 as the main entry point
- **Structure**: Monorepo-compatible with shared packages

### 2. Shared Navigation System
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop and mobile navigation
- **Module Integration**: Links to all four modules
- **Visual Design**: Custom color scheme with module-specific icons
- **User Experience**: Consistent navigation across all pages

### 3. Unified Dashboard
- **Module Overview**: Cards showing all four modules with descriptions
- **Recent Activity**: Mock activity feed showing user progress
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for each module
- **Quick Access**: Direct links to individual modules

### 4. Authentication System
- **NextAuth.js**: Unified authentication with Google and credentials providers
- **Session Management**: Shared session across all modules
- **Type Safety**: Extended TypeScript definitions for user sessions
- **API Routes**: Auth endpoints at `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`

### 5. Module Pages
- **Nomad Life**: `/nomad` - Digital nomad tools and travel planning
- **Polyverse**: `/polyverse` - Social networking and transparency tools
- **Everpath**: `/everpath` - Career development and learning paths
- **Curio Critters**: `/critters` - Educational RPG gaming platform

### 6. Technical Implementation
- **Build System**: Successfully builds with Next.js 15
- **Dependencies**: Integrated with existing workspace packages
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## Service Integration

### Port Configuration
- **Unified WebApp**: 3000 (main entry point)
- **Nomad Web**: 3000 (now unified)
- **Polyverse Web**: 3001 (available as standalone)
- **Everpath Web**: 3003 (available as standalone)
- **Critters Web**: 3005 (available as standalone)
- **Backend Services**: Various ports (8000-8080 range)

### API Proxy Configuration
- **Next.js Rewrites**: Configured to proxy API requests to backend services
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic routing based on path patterns
- **Development**: Seamless integration during development

## Development Experience

### Commands
```bash
# Start unified webapp
cd apps/unified-webapp && pnpm dev

# Build for production
cd apps/unified-webapp && pnpm build

# Start all services (including unified webapp)
pnpm dev:lite
```

### Testing
