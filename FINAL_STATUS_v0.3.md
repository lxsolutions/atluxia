# PolyVerse v0.3 - Final Implementation Status

## 🎉 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**All v0.2 and v0.3 features have been successfully implemented and are ready for deployment.**

## 📊 Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED (All Tasks)
- **Media Platform**: Upload → transcode → HLS playback + live streaming
- **Truth Archive**: Complete schemas, graph service, consensus lenses, reputation system
- **Arena Integration**: Full Tribute Battles import with dispute lifecycle
- **Mobile Skeleton**: Expo app with Shorts feed and HLS player
- **Quality Gates**: All tests passed, services integrated via docker-compose

### 🔄 PENDING FINAL PUSH
- **GitHub Authentication**: Token appears invalid, preventing final push
- **Remote Repository**: Ready for deployment once authentication resolved

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Resolve Authentication
```bash
# Update GitHub token or use SSH keys
git remote set-url origin <valid-repo-url>
git push origin monorepo/consolidation
```

### 2. Deploy Platform
```bash
# One-command startup
docker compose up -d

# Start development servers
pnpm turbo run dev
```

### 3. Verify Services
- Web app: http://localhost:3000
- Media service: Upload → HLS playback working
- Truth archive: Claim creation → consensus scoring
- Arena: Dispute creation → payment → resolution
