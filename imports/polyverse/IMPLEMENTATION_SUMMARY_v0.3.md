# PolyVerse v0.3 Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This document summarizes the complete implementation of PolyVerse v0.3 "MEDIA + TRUTH + RECEIPTS + ARENA + MOBILE" integration.

## 🎯 North Star Achieved

### A) Media Platform (VOD + Live)
- ✅ **Upload → S3/MinIO → ffmpeg transcode → HLS packaging → signed URL playback**
- ✅ **Live RTMP ingest → HLS with signed URLs**
- ✅ **Shorts (≤90s vertical) + VOD in web with HLS.js player**

### B) Receipted Recommenders
- ✅ **Algorithm Picker** with `recency_follow`, `diversity_dissent`, `locality_first`
- ✅ **TransparencyRecord** emission for all ranking computations
- ✅ **UI "Why this?"** showing features/weights in receipts

### C) Truth Archive v1
- ✅ **Truth Graph service** with CRUD + lineage + OpenSearch
- ✅ **Consensus Lenses**: L1 Evidence-First Bayes, L2 Expert Jury, L3 Community Notes, L4 Market Signal
- ✅ **Reputation System**: accuracy, calibration, peer-review, citation hygiene, topic expertise
- ✅ **ConfidenceReport + TransparencyRecord** emission for all computations

### D) Arena Integration
- ✅ **Tribute Battles** fully imported and integrated
- ✅ **Dispute lifecycle**: DRAFT→PENDING_PAYMENT→LOCKED→PLAYED→RESOLVED/VOID
- ✅ **Payments**: Stripe Connect + USDC testnet escrow
- ✅ **Verification**: SC2→AoE2→FAF adapters with manual fallback
- ✅ **PlayfulSignal** with ≤2% weight cap in consensus lenses

### E) Mobile Readiness
- ✅ **Expo skeleton** with login, Shorts feed, HLS player, create short
- ✅ **Shared auth & API clients** with web

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Media Stack
```
Upload → S3/MinIO → FFmpeg Transcode → HLS Manifest → Signed URL Playback
RTMP Ingest → HLS Packaging → Adaptive Streaming
```

### Truth Stack
```
Claim → Evidence → Consensus Lenses → ConfidenceReport → TransparencyRecord
Reputation → Jury Sampling → Verdict → Confidence Timeline
```

### Arena Stack
```
Dispute → Payment → Verification → Resolution → PlayfulSignal → Leaderboard
```

## ✅ Quality Gates Passed

### Infrastructure
- [x] `docker compose up -d` brings up all services
- [x] All services build successfully
- [x] CI green (lint/unit/e2e)

### Media Workflows
- [x] Upload short → feed shows with chosen algorithm
- [x] "Why this?" shows features/weights
- [x] Live ingest mock → HLS playable

### Truth Workflows
- [x] Create claim → attach evidence → run L1 & L2
- [x] ConfidenceReport + receipts generated
- [x] Truth Agent answers with citations or "insufficient evidence"

### Arena Workflows
- [x] Dispute → payment → verification → resolve
- [x] Leaderboard updates on resolution
- [x] Claim Arena tab shows W/L + PlayfulSignal receipts

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### One-Command Startup
```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm turbo run dev
```

### Services Running
- Web app (Next.js)
- Relay service
- Indexer service
- Media service + worker
- Truth graph service
- Reputation service
- Consensus service
- AI router service
- Games API (Arena)
- OpenSearch
- MinIO
- nginx-rtmp
- Redis
- NATS

## 📊 Metrics & Observability
