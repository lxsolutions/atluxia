# Branch Cleanup Recommendations

## Current Branch Status

### Active Branches
- **master** ✅ - Contains complete v0.4 implementation (merged from v0.4/social-media-truth)

### Branches to Keep
- **master** - Primary development branch with v0.4 complete

### Branches Recommended for Deletion

#### 1. `origin/v0.4/social-media-truth`
- **Status**: Merged into master
- **Reason**: Development complete, all features integrated
- **Action**: Safe to delete

#### 2. `origin/monorepo/consolidation`
- **Status**: Superseded by v0.4/social-media-truth
- **Reason**: Contains older v0.4 work that was completed in v0.4/social-media-truth
- **Action**: Safe to delete

#### 3. `origin/vercel/hobby-fixes`
- **Status**: Contains some fixes and claim bundles feature
- **Reason**: Claim bundles feature has been manually integrated into master
- **Action**: Safe to delete (useful commits cherry-picked)

#### 4. `origin/chore/fold-polyverse-cluster`
- **Status**: Documentation branch about folding services
- **Reason**: Historical documentation, no active development
- **Action**: Safe to delete or archive

## Cleanup Status - ✅ COMPLETED

### Branches Successfully Deleted
- ✅ `vercel/hobby-fixes` (local) - Deleted
- ✅ `origin/vercel/hobby-fixes` (remote) - Deleted
- ✅ `origin/monorepo/consolidation` (remote) - Deleted
- ✅ `origin/v0.4/social-media-truth` (remote) - Deleted

### Branches Kept
- ✅ `master` - Primary development branch
- ✅ `origin/chore/fold-polyverse-cluster` - Historical documentation (kept for reference)

### Current Branch Structure
```bash
git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/chore/fold-polyverse-cluster
  remotes/origin/master
```

## Post-Cleanup Branch Strategy

### Development Workflow
1. **master** - Main development branch for v0.4+
2. **feature/*** - Feature branches for new development
3. **hotfix/*** - Emergency fixes
4. **release/*** - Release preparation branches

### Branch Protection
- Enable branch protection on `master`
- Require pull requests for merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Require code review

## Next Development Cycle

For v0.5 development:
```bash
# Create feature branch from master
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/v0.5-new-feature

# Development work...

# Create PR to merge into master
git push origin feature/v0.5-new-feature
```

## Notes
- All v0.4 features are now in `master`
- The repository is ready for v0.5 development
- Clean branch structure improves maintainability
