## Technical Architecture

### Services Implemented
1. **Media Service** (Port 3006)
   - Enhanced media handling with Cloudflare Stream
   - Direct uploads and HLS playback

2. **Live Stream Service** (Port 3007)
   - Real-time streaming with chat
   - WebSocket connections and moderation

3. **Discovery Service** (Port 3008)
   - Recommendation algorithms
   - Transparency explanations

4. **Communities Service** (Port 3009)
   - Community management
   - Moderation tools

### Common Patterns
- **Transparency Records**: All services emit signed transparency records via NATS
- **TypeScript**: All services built with TypeScript and strict type checking
- **Fastify**: High-performance web framework for all services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Environment Configuration**: Consistent .env.example files

## Key Innovations

### Transparency-First Design
- Every ranking, moderation, consensus, payment, and verification step emits signed transparency records
- "Why this?" explanations provide algorithmic transparency
- Receipts visible in web and mobile interfaces

### Media Reliability
- Resumable uploads with Cloudflare Stream
- Content-type allowlist and size caps
- SSRF guards and security measures
- Live streaming with DVR and chat

### Algorithmic Diversity
- Multiple recommendation algorithms
- Voice balance with exposure quotas
- Diversity metrics and fairness monitoring

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks (Tasks 5-14)
- **Task 5**: Rooms - Realtime chat with moderation receipts
- **Task 6**: Truth Schemas/SDK - Schemas + SDK + vectors
- **Task 7**: Truth Graph & Search - CRUD + lineage + FTS + events
- **Task 8**: Reputation & Lenses - Lenses + merit + transparency
- **Task 9**: Truth Agent v1 - Citations-first Truth Agent + receipts
- **Task 10**: Payments: Tips MVP - Tips E2E + receipts
- **Task 11**: Federation Phase-2 - ActivityPub write (flagged)
- **Task 12**: Mobile App - Expo app MVP + shared SDKs
- **Task 13**: Governance & Transparency - Constitution v0.4 + logs UI
- **Task 14**: DevOps, Seeds, CI - Compose + seeds + CI + dashboards

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete the remaining services (Rooms, Truth, Payments)
2. Implement mobile app with shared SDKs
3. Add comprehensive testing and CI/CD
4. Deploy and configure observability dashboards

## Success Metrics
